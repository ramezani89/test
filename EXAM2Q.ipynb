Your task is to create a GeoDataFrame using the given polygon coordinates. Additionally, define a function named calculate_perimeter that takes the GeoDataFrame as input. This function should calculate the perimeters of the polygons and return a dictionary where the region IDs are the keys and the corresponding perimeters are the values.\n\nUtilize the methods and techniques taught in our lectures to transform the columns of the GeoDataFrame, making them suitable for dictionary creation within your function definition.
